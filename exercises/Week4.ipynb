    "# Prelude: Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we have to get a little head start on the _Natural Language Processing_ part of the class. This is a new direction for us. Up to now, we've mostly been doing math-y stuff with Python, but today, we're going to be using Python to work through a text. The central thing we need to be able to do today, is to extract internal wikipedia links (links between wiki-pages). And for that we need regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "The recipe below is what I told the class to do before LLMs. If you want to try to learn about regular expressions on your own, that's what you need to do. <b>BUT!</b> You don't have to. <b>For this part, it's OK to use an LLM to help you as much as you possibly can.</b> The reason I'm saying this is that I don't think having an intimate knowledge of regular expressions is important for the content of this class.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "That said, <b>using an LLM means that you have to do extra checking and testing</b>. Make sure that the code you get from your LLM actually does what you asked it to do by going through some examples and manually checking (use a real wiki page or the test-text below). If your LLM hallucinated the wrong answer and you still use the data that comes out, it will count negatively in our evaluations.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Reading/Video*\n",
    "> * Read [**this tutorial**](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions) to form an overview of regular expressions. This is important to understand the content of the tutorial (also very useful later), so you may actually want to work through the examples. \n",
    "> * (**Experiment**: An alternative to reading. If you love videos more than reading, you can also check out [this YouTube explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk) instead of going through the tutorial above -- it's a friendly looking young man called Kyle who goes through RegExps from his bedroom. I haven't watched the whole thing ... since I personally don't like video explainers ... but it has many views + thumbs up.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Exercises_: Regular expressions round 1\\.\n",
    "> * Now, explain in your own words: what are regular expressions?\n",
    "> * Provide an example of a regex to match 4 digits numbers (by this, I mean precisely 4 digits, you should not match any part of numbers with e.g. 5 digits). In your notebook, use `findall` to show that your regex works on this [test-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2020/master/files/regex_exercise.txt). **Hint**: a great place to test out regular expressions is: https://regex101.com.\n",
    "> * Provide an example of a regex to match words starting with \"super\". Show that it works on the [test-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2020/master/files/regex_exercise.txt).\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can go on to figure out how how to match internal wiki links. Wiki links come in two flavors. They're always enclosed in double square brackets, e.g. `[[wiki-link]]` and can either occur like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... some text [[Aristotle]] some more text ...\n",
    "\n",
    "which links to the page [`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second flavor has two parts, so that links can handle spaces and other more fancy forms of references, here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... some text [[John_McCain|John McCain]] some more text ...\n",
    "\n",
    "which links to the page [`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain). Now it's your turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Exercise_: Regular expressions round 2\\. Show that you can extract the wiki-links from the [test-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2022/master/files/regex_exercise.txt). Perhaps you can find inspiration on stack overflow or similar. **Hint**: Try to solve this exercise on your own (that's what you will get the most out of - learning wise), but if you get stuck ... you will find the solution in one of the video lectures below.\n",

    "The files contain names and corresponding wiki-link, but pages can be missing or redirected. If you encounter re-directs, you can follow the redirect link and see if you can recover a page that's not already in your database.  (But you do not have to do that either - it's fine to just skip ... many new issues can arise if you try to follow the redirects).\n",

    ">   - Hint 0: Make sure you read the [Wiki API pages](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to ensure that your **download the cleanest possible version of the page (the wikitext)**. [This link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55779015/get-wikitext-from-wikipedia-api) may be helpful.\n",
    ">   - Hint 1: You may want to save the individual band/artist pages on your computer. You can use your skills from the first lectures to write them as plain-text files (that's what I would do - one file per band/artist, named according to its wiki-link). (But you can also use pickle files or start a database if you like that better.)\n",
    ">   - Hint 2: If you now have a directory with all those files, you can use [`os.listdir()`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-os-listdir-method/) to list all the files in that directory within Python and iterate over the files if you need to.\n",

    ">   - Then slowly build the loops over performers/pages to take your little operation to industrial scale\n",
    ">   - You don't have to be perfect. There will be tricky edge-cases, you don't have to solve all of those. The key is to get a pretty good network to work with, not to make everything perfect.\n",
    "> * For each link you extract, check if the target is a person from your list of performers. If yes, keep it. If no, discard it.\n",
    "> * Use a NetworkX [`DiGraph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/digraph.html) to store the network.\n",
    "> * Store the `length of the content` as an attribute of the node (i.e. count the number of *words* you have in each character's page). By storing this information as a nodal features, we keep all the relevant data in one place. The safe way to count words without counting symbols is to use `regex`, but simpler methods are OK.\n",
    "> * When have you finished, you'll notice that some nodes do not have any out- and in- degrees. Unless you've made a mistake, those are truly isolated bands/singers. Double check for mistakes, then *discard* those disconnected nodes from the network.\n",
    "> * Finally, extract the largest component - it will make our work with visualisations much easier (note: removing *isolated* nodes (with no links) does not guarantee that you are left with the largest component).\n",
    ">     - *Note 1*: For directed graphs use `weakly connected component` to extract the largest component. You can also check the hints on how to extract the largest component of a graph from Week 1 notebook.\n",

    "If you want to make things more fancy, note that Wikipedia writes that local minima is a problem for these graphs: \"It is easy to see that force-directed algorithms produce a graph with minimal energy, in particular one whose total energy is only a local minimum. The local minimum found can be, in many cases, considerably worse than a global minimum, which translates into a low-quality drawing. For many algorithms, especially the ones that allow only down-hill moves of the vertices, the final result can be strongly influenced by the initial layout, that in most cases is randomly generated. The problem of poor local minima becomes more important as the number of vertices of the graph increases. **A combined application of different algorithms is helpful to solve this problem**. For example, using the Kamada–Kawai algorithm to quickly generate a reasonable initial layout and then the Fruchterman–Reingold algorithm to improve the placement of neighbouring nodes.\" (my emphasis) "
