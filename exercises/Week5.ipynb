    "> _Reading_: This week, the reading is mostly for reference. It's for you to have a place to go, if you want more detailed information about the topics that I cover in the video lectures. Thus, I recommend you check out **Chapter 9** of the network science book. In particular, we'll delve into Section 9.4 in the exercises below. We will also talk a little bit about degree correlations - you can read about those in **Chapter 7**."

    "There are [many backbone extraction algorithms](https://www.michelecoscia.com/?page_id=287), and I've chosen to talk about the *Disparity Filter* here, because it's the oldest and most commonly used method (so I though you should know about it). Plus, it'll probably be the relevant method for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice, however, presents us with a problem: As I explain in the video, the Disparity Filter method *only works on weighted networks*. But our network does not have edge weights in any kind of natural way (since there's usually just a single link between two wiki pages). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So to get rid of unimportant edges, we'll have to try something different. I present you with three possible methods below. For the first two ones, we'll add weights proportional to the [edge betweenness centrality](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.edge_betweenness_centrality.html). The edge betweenness centrality is just like the node betweenness centrality that you know and love ... only that it's defined for *edges* instead of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create two new weighted networks based on the edge betweenness\n",
    " * **Weighted Network 1**: The ***undirected*** Rock Music Network (Giant Connected Component) but with edge weights proportional to the edge betweenness centrality (let's renormalize so that the lowest weight is equal to 1 and the highest weight is equal to 100).\n",
    " * **Weighted Network 2**: The ***undirected*** Rock Music Network  (Giant Connected Component) but with edge weights proportional to 1/(edge weight in Weighted Network 1).\n",

You can implement the disparity filter yourself based on the [scientific paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0808904106) or find an implentation on GitHub (there are several ones to choose from ... I like [this implementation](https://www.michelecoscia.com/?page_id=287), which also includes other interesting edge filters). Figure out how your particular backbone extractor works (you may have to inspect the code itself, these packages are not always well documented). Play around with values of $\\alpha$ to get an aestetically pleasing visualization (but don't make the resulting network too sparse).\n",
    "> 2. Plot the resulting three networks using ForceAtlas2, still sizing nodes according to total degree. No need to color them. If your backbone has some disconnected nodes, feel free to not plot them. And remember to calculate a new layout to see how the structure has changed.\n",
    "> 3. Comment on your results\n",
    ">    * Do you see any structures in the networks now? Inspect some nodes to get a sense of what the structures captures in the three networks. Describe your findings in your own words.\n",
    ">    * Weighted network 1, 2, and 3 are very different. In 1 and 2, we have removed edges with low/high edge betweenness centrality respectively and HSH is based on shortest paths. What have the various filters done to the networks? Describe what you see visually, and your explain your thoughts on what we've done to the network structures.\n",

    "There's a lot to do today, so knock youself out with your LLM for this exercise, hopefully it can make your life easier (although I hope you'll do a bit of your own thinking, since a lot of complicated conceptual things are going on with the interplay between the backboning and edge betweenness and inverse edge betweenness!)</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "One final thing. For now, the backbones are mostly for visualization. Especially because the edge weights are a bit artificial. Generally, it's not exactly clear what kind of information we get rid off when removing the non-backbone edges -- and in our case it's even less clear because I've made up two of the methods. Thus, we'll still do the exercises during the following weeks using the full network that preserves all of the connection information.\n"
